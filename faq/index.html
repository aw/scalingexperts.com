			<h3>Who wrote this eBook?</h3>
<p>The author is <a href="http://www.alexwilliams.ca" target="_blank">Alex Williams</a>, although it is published under &#8220;<em><strong>The Scaling Experts</strong></em>&#8221; due to the collaboration of many expert system/network administrators in the IT industry.</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>The &#8220;<em><strong>Web Scaling vol. 1</strong></em>&#8221; eBook is for people just getting started in the world of scalability. It is mainly written for supporters of Open Source Software wanting to grow their infrastructure without incurring incredibly high costs.</p>
<h3>How much do you love Open Source?</h3>
<p>We love Open Source Software so much, that we promise to <a href="https://my.fsf.org/donate/" target="_blank">donate</a> part of the eBook sales proceeds to the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2012 we are glad to confirm our donation to the FSF.</p>
<h3>Why isn&#8217;t the eBook free or Open Source?</h3>
<p>While we strive to provide our eBooks <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984" target="_blank">DRM-free</a>, we believe the time and effort required to gather information, test scripts and code, create and draw architecture designs, and format information in a presentable way deserves a form of compensation. As with any work, the sales of this eBook will allow and encourage us to continue contributing to the community in other ways.</p>
<h3>Can I distribute this eBook?</h3>
<p>No. This work is <em>Copyright © Alex Williams</em> and can in no way be distributed, printed for commercial use or resold. Please respect the author and contributors by not infringing on the copyright. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Do you provide volume discounts?</h3>
<p>Yes of course! Volume discounts exist for 5 or more copies of the eBook. Visit the contact page and send me an email with the quantity you would like to purchase.</p>
<h3>Can I re-download the eBook at a later date?</h3>
<p>Generally no, your download link will automatically expire after <strong>24 hours</strong>, but the eBook can be downloaded <strong>2 times</strong> within that time-slot, as we know sometimes downloads can be interrupted or canceled by accident.</p>
<h3>What if my download link expired?</h3>
<p>Visit the contact page and send me an email with your purchase details. I&#8217;ll regenerate a new download link for you.</p>
<h3>What payment methods are accepted?</h3>
<p>We use a <a href="http://www.e-junkie.com/?r=175131" target="_blank">3rd party payment processor</a>, so whatever they support, we support:</p>
<ul>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your credit card statement will display <strong>*SCALNXPERTS*</strong> or <strong>*SCALINGEXPERTS*</strong> or <strong>*UNSCRAMBLHK*</strong> or <strong>*UNSCRAMBLEHKLIMITED*</strong></p>
<h3>What is Unscramble HK Limited?</h3>
<p><i>Unscramble HK Limited</i> is the incorporated company used for selling our eBooks online.</p>
<h3>In what currency do you sell?</h3>
<p>The eBooks are advertised in <strong>US</strong> dollars. Depending on your country, the cart may or may not list or allow you to display the final price in your country&#8217;s currency.</p>
<h3>Do you offer a money-back guarantee?</h3>
<p>Yes! I offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. I believe everything for sale must have value. If you think this eBook was completely useless to you and you didn&#8217;t learn a thing and you&#8217;re just not satisfied with the work, then I&#8217;ll provide a full refund for your purchase.</p>
<h3>What information do you store?</h3>
<p>We don&#8217;t store ANY of your information on our servers. Actually, we don&#8217;t even use cookies! Although our 3rd party visitor  statistics tool might store a cookie to count visits. Our eCommerce cart provider stores your email address and order information in a secure location. They do not store your shipping/billing address. I may use your email address in order to contact you with eBook updates, information and promotions regarding related products and services. I WILL NOT provide or sell your information to 3rd parties.</p>
<h3>How scalable is this website?</h3>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be ironic if a website for scaling was unavailable due to scaling issues? Well, no. For me it would be quite humiliating, but the truth is it&#8217;s extremely difficult to justify the purchase of a scalable infrastructure for this eBook&#8217;s website, until it becomes more popular and starts generating more revenue. For the moment, I&#8217;ll do my best to make sure it&#8217;s &#8220;<em>always up</em>&#8220;, but the goal of this website isn&#8217;t necessarily to serve thousands of viewers per day. In fact, if this website isn&#8217;t available for a long period of time, it&#8217;s likely (and unfortunately) caused by malicious attackers.</p>
<h3>Do you support IPv6?</h3>
<p>Of course!</p>
<p><a href="http://ipv6-test.com/validate.php?url=referer"><img class="alignleft" title="ipv6 ready" src="../wp-content/uploads/2011/06/button-ipv6-big.png" border="0" alt="ipv6 ready" /></a><br />
<!-- IPv6-test.com button END --><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Do you offer paid consulting?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I am available to help with current and future scaling requirements. Although my time is very limited, I am occasionally available for iChat, Skype, and in-person consultations. Please visit the contact page and email me to organize a paid consultation.</p>
